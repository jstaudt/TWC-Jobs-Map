TWC Jobs Map is an application built with Laravel, Vue.js, and the Google Maps API.  Job records from the Texas Workforce Commission are imported into a MySQL database, and gecodes are obtained through the Google API. Once the data is in place, users can filter by their chosen criteria to determine which jobs are displayed in the map window.
